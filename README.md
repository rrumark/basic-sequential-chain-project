Project: Basic Sequential Chain
Notebook: "basic-sequential-chain-project.ipynb"

This project illustrates how to build a basic sequential chain using LangChain. It integrates two interconnected chains:

Genre Recommender: Suggests related movie genres based on the userâ€™s preferred genre.
Movie Recommender: Provides movie recommendations derived from the suggested genres.

Key Components:
AzureChatOpenAI: Leverages Azure's OpenAI API for the language model operations.
PromptTemplate: Configures the prompts used by the language model.
SimpleSequentialChain: Connects the two chains, ensuring a smooth flow from genre recommendation to movie selection.
